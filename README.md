üë§ **ABOUT ME**: I‚Äôm a Data Engineer with hands-on experience in building data-driven solutions using technologies like Python, Pandas, Apache Airflow, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, etc. My expertise lies in ETL pipeline development, data processing, and workflow orchestration, with a strong background in automating data workflows and optimizing backend architectures. I've successfully worked on projects involving data integration, AI/ML model deployment, and cloud-based data solutions. While I have experience in both frontend and backend development, my primary focus and passion lie in data engineering and scalable backend systems.
